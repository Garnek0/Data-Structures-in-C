I decided to do some data structure implementations in C for fun.

## Data structures

- [ ] Doubly Linked List (dllist)
- [x] Stack (stack)
- [x] Queue (queue)
- [ ] Double-Ended Queue (deque)
- [ ] Hashmap (hashmap)
- [ ] Binary Tree (bintree)
- [ ] Binary Search Tree (sbintree)
- [ ] Full Binary Tree (fbintree)
- [ ] Complete Binary Tree (cbintree)
- [ ] Balanced Tree (btree)
- [ ] Unbalanced Tree (unbtree)
