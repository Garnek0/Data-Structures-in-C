# Data Structure Implementations in C

I decided to do some data structure implementations in C for fun.

## Data structures

- [x] Singly Linked List (sllist)
- [x] Doubly Linked List (dllist)
- [x] Stack (stack)
- [x] Queue (queue)
- [ ] Double-Ended Queue (deque)
- [ ] Hashmap (hashmap)
- [ ] Binary Tree (bintree)
